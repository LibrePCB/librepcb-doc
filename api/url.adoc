[#api-url]
=== URL

An API URL consists of following parts:

[cols="^20%m,50%,30%",options="header"]
|===============================================================================
| Part          | Description               | Example
| <BASE>        | Base URL of API server    | https://api.librepcb.org
| /api          | Base path of API          | `/api`
| /<VERSION>    | API version number        | `/v1`
| /<RESOURCE>   | The requested resource
                  (may contain subpaths)    | `/libraries/v0.1`
|===============================================================================

The base URL of the official API server is https://api.librepcb.org/, but for
your own API server you can use any other base URL. This is the URL which must
be specified in the workspace settings of LibrePCB.

Currently the only available API version is `v1`, but in future there might
be newer API specifications available with higher version numbers. Because the
version number is part of the URL, a server could support multiple API versions
at the same time.
