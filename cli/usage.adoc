                                 non-approved warnings/errors and report failure
                                 (exit code = 1) if there are non-approved
                                 messages.
  --export-schematics <file>     Export schematics to given file(s). Existing
                                 files will be overwritten. Supported file
                                 extensions: pdf
  --export-pcb-fabrication-data  Export PCB fabrication data (Gerber/Excellon)
                                 according the fabrication output settings of
                                 boards. Existing files will be overwritten.

===== Example: Check ERC Messages and Export Schematics & Boards

This command is useful for Continuous Integration of LibrePCB projects because
it reports failure if you check in projects with non-approved ERC messages. In
addition, it generates all production data so you don't have to do it manually.

.Command
[source,bash]
----
$ ./librepcb-cli open-project \
    --erc \
    --export-schematics="output/{{VERSION}}/{{PROJECT}}_Schematics.pdf" \
    --export-pcb-fabrication-data \
    MyProject.lpp
----

.Output
----

In this example, the application reported errors and exited with code 1
because there are non-approved ERC messages.
