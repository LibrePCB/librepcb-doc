== Portable Package

The recommended way to install LibrePCB is to download the portable `*.dmg`
file:

*Download {bundle-url}[{bundle-filename}] and double-click it in Finder.
Then drag and drop the app onto the "Applications" folder in Finder.*
Afterwards you'll find LibrePCB in the Launchpad.

== Online Installer

Alternatively you could install LibrePCB with the online installer. This
also installs a maintenance tool which allows to update LibrePCB once
a new release is available.

Download {installer-url}[{installer-filename}]. Right-click on the downloaded
file and choose btn:[Open] from the context menu (because the application is
considered as _unverified_). Then double-click on the contained file to run
the installer.
