= Build From Sources
:source-filename: librepcb-{version}-source.zip
:source-url: {releases-url}/{source-filename}

== Requirements

To compile LibrePCB, you need to install the following tools & libraries first:

* pass:[g++], MinGW or Clang (any version with pass:[C++17] support should work)
* http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/[Qt] >= 6.2 (make sure the
  https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtimageformats-index.html[imageformats] plugin
  is installed too as it will be needed at runtime)
* https://www.opencascade.com/[OpenCASCADE] OCCT or OCE (optional, OCCT
  highly preferred)
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Utility_Library[OpenGL Utility Library]
  GLU (optional)
* http://www.zlib.net/[zlib]
* https://www.openssl.org/[OpenSSL]
* https://cmake.org/[CMake] 3.16 or newer

[IMPORTANT]
====
Actually LibrePCB 1.2.0 still compiles with Qt5, but unfortunately contains a
serious bug at runtime. Therefore you really need to use Qt6 where the bug
doesn't exist. We'll drop support for Qt5 soon anyway.

== Get the Sources

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is very important to use the correct sources:

* *Do NOT clone any branch (e.g. `master`) from our repository on GitHub!*
  These sources are not compatible with the stable file format of LibrePCB.
* Do NOT use the archives provided at the GitHub Releases page. These do not
  include the submodules and thus can't be compiled.
* It's fine to clone the official release *tag* (current: `{version}`) from
  our repository on GitHub, just keep in mind to pass `--recursive` to also
  get all the submodules.
====

For convenience, we provide an official source archive which contains all the
required files (including submodules) and has stripped any unnecessary files:
{source-url}[{source-filename}]

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
wget "{source-url}"
unzip ./{source-filename}
cd ./librepcb-{version}
----

== Build LibrePCB

Within the downloaded source directory, execute the following commands:

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j8
----

== Additional Resources

These are just the most important commands. For more details (e.g. the
available configuration flags), check out the following resources:

* https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/blob/master/README.md[`README.md`]
  within the source archive
