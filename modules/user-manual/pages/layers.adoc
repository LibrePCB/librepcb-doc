= Layers

Layers are an integral part of every EDA software, thus it's important to
know what they're intended for and how to use them. Note that all existing
layers are described here, but the availability of layers within LibrePCB
depends on the context. For example the layers _Top/Bottom Courtyards_ are
only available in the package editor, but not in the board editor since
they make only sense within packages.

== Schematic Layers

Sheet Frames::
  Intended to be used within symbols to draw schematic sheet frames (graphics
  and texts).
  Usually not used directly within schematics, but mainly in symbols.
  No special treatment by LibrePCB.

Documentation::
  General purpose layer for graphics and texts, e.g. to add some additional
  information to a schematic (like a formula, or a dawing of an external
  device).
  Not recommended (but possible) to be used within symbols.
  No special treatment by LibrePCB.

Comments::
  General purpose layer intended for comment annotations within schematics.
  Not recommended (but possible) to be used within symbols.
  No special treatment (yet) by LibrePCB.
+
Example: Text "Place C1 close to U1" next to the symbols of C1/U1

Guide::
  General purpose layer for graphics and texts, e.g. to draw boxes around
  parts of a schematic and give them a title.
  Not recommended (but possible) to be used within symbols.
  No special treatment by LibrePCB.

Outlines::
  Intended to draw outlines/content of symbols (e.g. a rectangle for an IC,
  or a thick line for a GND symbol).
  No special treatment by LibrePCB.
+
Example: xref:library-conventions:symbols.adoc#outline[Symbol Conventions]

Hidden Grab Areas::
  Used to define custom grab areas of symbols by drawing closed polygons
  or circles. These areas are not visible in the schematic editor, but
  the editor allows to grab symbols within these areas.
  Only available in the symbol editor, not in the schematic editor.
+
Example: xref:library-conventions:symbols.adoc#grab-area[Symbol Conventions]

Names::
  Intended for the `+{{NAME}}+` text of symbols.
  Not used directly within schematics, only in symbols.
  No special treatment by LibrePCB.
+
Example: xref:library-conventions:symbols.adoc#text-elements[Symbol Conventions]

Values::
  Intended for the `+{{VALUE}}+` text of symbols.
  Not used directly within schematics, only in symbols.
  No special treatment by LibrePCB.
+
Example: xref:library-conventions:symbols.adoc#text-elements[Symbol Conventions]

== Board Layers

Sheet Frames::
  Intended to be used within footprints to draw board sheet frames (graphics
  and texts).
  Usually not used directly within boards, but mainly in footprints.
  Ignored by the Gerber export, but usually contained when printing.

Board Outlines::
  *Mandatory layer* where a single, closed board outline polygon (or circle)
  must be drawn. The line represents the board edge after manufacturing.
  It's highly recommended to set its width to zero since it has no meaning.
  This layer will be exported to Gerber files and is usually contained when
  printing the board.
+
Example:
xref:quickstart:create-project/board.adoc#draw-outlines[Draw Board Outline]
+
[NOTE]
====
In the board editor layers dock, this layer is named _Outlines_ and is
coupled with the _Board Cutouts_ layer.
====

Board Cutouts::
  Any non-plated board cut-outs (millings) more complex than slotted holes
  must be drawn on this layer as polygons or circles. The line represents
  the board edge after manufacturing. It's highly recommended to set its
  width to zero since it has no meaning.
  This layer will be exported to Gerber files (into the same file as the
  _Board Outlines_ layer) and is usually contained when printing the board.
+
Example:
xref:quickstart:create-project/board.adoc#draw-outlines[Draw Board Outline]
+
[NOTE]
====
In the board editor layers dock, this layer is named _Outlines_ and is
coupled with the _Board Outlines_ layer.
====

Plated Board Cutouts::
+
[CAUTION]
====
Not supported yet (ignored in the Gerber export)!
====

Measures::
  General purpose layer for graphics and texts, e.g. to add manual
  measurements (e.g. the PCB size) to the board.
  Not recommended (but possible) to be used within footprints.
  Ignored by the Gerber export, but might be contained when printing.

Alignment::
  Intended to add alignment helper drawings to footprints, mainly just
  straight lines with zero width. For example in an edge-mounted device,
  the exact location of the board edge could be drawn on this layer as a
  help/reference for the board designer to correctly place the device in
  relation to the board edge.
  Ignored by the Gerber export, and usually not contained when printing.

Documentation::
  General purpose layer for graphics and texts, e.g. to add some additional
  information or drawings to a board.
  Not recommended (but possible) to be used within footprints.
  Ignored by the Gerber export, but might be contained when printing.

Comments::
  General purpose layer intended for comment annotations within boards.
  Not recommended (but possible) to be used within footprints.
  Ignored by the Gerber export, but might be contained when printing.

Guide::
  General purpose layer for graphics and texts, e.g. to draw boxes around
  parts of a board and give them a title.
  Not recommended (but possible) to be used within footprints.
  Ignored by the Gerber export, but might be contained when printing.

Top/Bottom Names::
  Intended for the `+{{NAME}}+` text of footprints.
  Not used directly within boards, only in footprints.
  Usually printed on silkscreen (by the Gerber export), depending on the
  board setup configuration.
+
Example:
xref:library-conventions:packages.adoc#text-elements[Package Conventions]

Top/Bottom Values::
  Intended for the `+{{VALUE}}+` text of footprints.
  Not used directly within boards, only in footprints.
  Might be printed on silkscreen (by the Gerber export), depending on the
  board setup configuration.
+
Example:
xref:library-conventions:packages.adoc#text-elements[Package Conventions]

Top/Bottom Legend::
  Intended for any drawings to appear on silkscreen, e.g. device
  placement/orientation lines, pin-1 dots and custom text.
  To be used within footprints or directly within boards.
  Typical line width is 0.2 mm, recommended minimum is 0.1 mm.
  Usually printed on silkscreen (by the Gerber export), depending on the
  board setup configuration.
+
Example:
xref:library-conventions:packages.adoc#legend-layer[Package Conventions]

Top/Bottom Documentation::
  Intended for drawings to represent devices in a nice way, including
  body outlines, leads and polarity/pin-1 markings. Basically as a 2D
  projection of the 3D model to somehow see the packages in 2D views,
  for example to export a nice looking assembly plan.
  Ignored by the Gerber export, but usually contained when printing.
+
Example:
xref:library-conventions:packages.adoc#documentation-layer[Package Conventions]

Top/Bottom Package Outlines::
  Intended for footprints to draw the exact mechanical outlines of the
  device to be assembled.
  To be drawn with a zero-width polygon or circle.
  Used by the DRC to detect and warn about overlapping devices, or devices
  placed within the courtyard of another device. This DRC check doesn't
  work if no package outline is drawn.

Top/Bottom Courtyard::
  Intended for footprints to draw the courtyard (clearance) of the device
  to be assembled, typically just the package outlines with a small offset
  (e.g. 0.2 mm).
  To be drawn with a zero-width polygon or circle.
  Used by the DRC to detect and warn about devices placed within the
  courtyard of another device. This DRC check doesn't work if no courtyard
  is drawn.

Top/Bottom Hidden Grab Areas::
  Used to define custom grab areas of footprints by drawing closed polygons
  or circles. These areas are not visible in the board editor, but
  the editor allows to grab devices within these areas.
  Only available in the footprint editor, not in the board editor.

Top/Bottom Stop Mask::
  Used to add solder resist openings, i.e. areas on the PCB where no solder
  resist shall be applied. So in contrast to most other layers, this layer
  has inverted polarity. Note that LibrePCB adds content on this layer
  automatically where necessary (pads, holes etc.), so manual usage of
  this layer is generally not needed. But it still allows to add custom
  solder resist openings.
  Any content on this layer is exported to the corresponding Gerber files.

Top/Bottom Solder Paste::
  Used to add stencil openings, i.e. areas on the PCB where solder paste is
  applied for reflow soldering of THT devices. Note that LibrePCB adds
  content on this layer automatically for SMT pads, so manual usage of
  this layer is generally not needed. But it still allows to add custom
  solder paste areas.
  Any content on this layer is exported to the corresponding Gerber files.

Top/Bottom Finish::
+
[CAUTION]
====
Not supported yet (ignored in the Gerber export)!
====

Top/Bottom Glue::
+
[CAUTION]
====
Not supported yet (ignored in the Gerber export)!
====

Top/Inner/Bottom Copper::
  Should be pretty clear ðŸ™‚ Inner layers are numbered from top to bottom,
  i.e. _Inner Copper 1_ is just below _Top Copper_ and on a 6-layer PCB
  _Inner Copper 4_ is just above _Bottom Copper_.

== Custom Layers

To allow sharing symbols and footprints between users, it's crucial that
the purpose of every layer is identical for each user. Therefore LibrePCB
does not allow to add custom, user-defined layers.

If the built-in layers are not sufficient for you, please
https://librepcb.org/help/[let us know].
