This chapter provides detailed documentation about concepts and features
of LibrePCB. In contrast to the
xref:quickstart:index.adoc[Quickstart Tutorial], it does not need to be
read in a particular order -- just read the sections you're interested in
to learn more about LibrePCB.

[NOTE]
====
There are only very few things documented yet.
