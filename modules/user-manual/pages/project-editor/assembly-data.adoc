= Assembly Data

This chapter explains how to specify assembly data like
MPNsfootnote:[Manufacturer part numbers] in your project to get
an accurate BOMfootnote:[Bill of materials] ready to order the correct parts.
LibrePCB supports many different use-cases which will be explained below.

[NOTE]
====
Assembly data is a rather advanced topic, and often not that relevant for
simple hobby projects which are assembled by hand. So for your first steps
with LibrePCB, you could simply ignore this whole topic. LibrePCB will
let you generate a BOM for your project anyway, it might just be less
accurate (e.g. missing exact MPNs).
====

== Assembly Variants

First of all, you should understand the concept of assembly variants because
the assembly data of each part is related to an assembly variant.

*Basically an assembly variant simply represents a variation of the BOM*.
For each assembly variant you'll get a separate BOM which may differ in
which parts are contained, or what MPNs are specified for the parts.
So if you project contains 5 assembly variants, the BOM export will create
5 BOM files.

Every project requires to contain at least one assembly variant. LibrePCB
therefore automatically adds a default variant called _Std_ when you create
a new project. In many cases, this is sufficient and you don't need to care
about assembly variants at all.

However, there are use-cases where you want to generate different BOMs for
a single PCB project. Usually this is desired if multiple different products
are created from the same PCB, differing only on the assembled parts.
For example the same PCB could be assembled with either an RS485 interface,
or with an Ethernet interface (or both). Or a voltage regulator module can
either output 3.3V or 5V, depending on the value of an assembled resistor.

To define the assembly variants, open menu:Project[Project Setup] or press
kbd:[F6] and navigate to the *Assembly Variants* tab:

A new assembly variant can only be added by duplicating an existing one.
The new variant will then initially contain exactly the same parts as
the existing one.

[TIP]
====
*It's highly recommended to keep the variant name as short as possible*
(e.g. just _5V_ instead of _OutputVoltage5V_) because it will be part of
the file name of the exported BOMs. It must therefore also not contain
any special characters. A more descriptive name may by specified in
the _Description_ field.
====

If one of the variants is considered as the default or most used variant,
it's recommended to move it to the top of the list. Some features in
LibrePCB will respect only the first assembly variant, no matter how
many are defined.

== Component Assembly Data

The assembly variants explained above are defined at project scope, i.e.
they are valid for a whole project. This section now describes what
assembly data is defined on _component scope_.

=== Add Component By MPN

Often, assembly data for a component consists of a manufacturer name and
an MPN (the part number). Those two values are sufficient to know which
part needs to be ordered from your supplier.

The easiest way to add this data to a component is at the time when you
add a new component to the schematic. Maybe you remember this screenshot
from the
xref:quickstart:create-project/schematics.adoc#add-devices[Quickstart Tutorial]:

image::quickstart:schematic-add-device.png[alt="Add device"]

You can add either a _component_, a _device_ or a _part_ to the schematic.
Components and devices however do not contain any assembly data. But if
you add a part, the component in the schematic will automatically contain
the MPN and (usually) the manufacturer as assembly data. So in that case,
no manual action is needed anymore.

=== Assembly Data Editor

No matter if you added components by MPN to the schematic or not, the
assembly data of a component can always be manually edited in its properties
dialog. This is also required for more complex scenarios, e.g. if you
like to exclude a component from a particular assembly variant or if
you like to specify second source parts.

Click on menu:Properties[] from the components context menu or select the
component in the schematic and press kbd:[E]:

image::component-assembly-data.png[alt="Component assembly data"]

Each row in this table represents one assembly data set (or a _part_). Note
that each part is valid only for a particular device -- for example an
OpAmp might be provided in a SOT23-5 package by one device, and in a
DIP8 package by another device. So it's clear their order information will
be different. Thus the first column specifies for which device a part is
valid for.

In the last column, you can specify for which assembly variants a part
is valid for, i.e. in which variants the part shall be assembled.

The three columns in the middle contain the actual assembly data which
is accessed by the BOM export. This might be an MPN and manufacturer name,
but it might also be just a single attribute like `CAPACITANCE=100nF`.
Empty fields do not mean the part will be excluded from the BOM -- the
corresponding BOM fields will just be empty as well.

[NOTE]
====
Unfortunately the UI is be a bit confusing at the moment, we'll try to
improve it in upcoming releases. The most important thing to know is
that *the attributes editor at the bottom is related to the selected row in
the assembly options table*. So to specify an attribute for a particular
assembly option, select the corresponding row and add the attribute to
the table afterwards.

If no assembly option is selected, the attributes table displays the
attributes set *directly on the component* (i.e. attributes not depending
on assembly variants).
====

No worries if you don't fully understand the concept yet. The sections
below will show you concrete examples for each of the possible use-cases.

=== Example: Specify MPN

As mentioned above, each part could either be represented by an MPN plus
manufacturer name, or just as simple attributes. If you want to have an
MPN contained in the BOM, click on the btn:[Add Part By MPN] button and
choose a part. If the desired part doesn't exist in the library, just
choose a device instead and type in the MPN and manufacturer manually.
The result should then look like this:

image::assembly-data-by-mpn.png[alt="Assembly data by MPN"]

[NOTE]
====
* A row in the table needs to be selected to enable the mentioned button
  (not shown in the screenshot for readability reasons).
* If there's no row in the table at all yet, use the upper button
  btn:[Add Device] instead. It works the same way, but adds a new
  assembly option (i.e. a row) instead of modifying an existing one.
====

=== Example: Specify Attributes

If you don't care about an exact MPN but just want to specify some
attributes (like the capacitance of a capacitor), select the corresponding
row and add the attributes to the attributes table. The result should
look like that:

image::assembly-data-by-attributes.png[alt="Assembly data by attributes"]

[NOTE]
====
* If there's no shopping cart symbol in the desired row, you first need
  to add initial part information with the btn:[Add Part By MPN] button
  as explained in the previous section. Just select a device instead of
  a part.
* If there's no row in the table at all yet, use the upper button
  btn:[Add Device] first and select the desired device. Afterwards
  proceed as explained above.

Unfortunately this procedure is a bit cumbersome, we'll try to improve
it in upcoming releases.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Note that these attributes are not automatically included in the BOM.
Usually, only the `+{{VALUE}}+` of components is included, so it's
recommended to include any relevant attributes in the component's value.

For example if you want to have the attributes `+{{CAPACITANCE}}+` and
`+{{VOLTAGE}}+` of a (capacitor) component included in the BOM, set the
component value to this:

[source]
----
{{CAPACITANCE}}
{{VOLTAGE}}
----
====

=== Example: Do Not Mount

A typical use-case of assembly variants is to simply exclude some
components from particular assembly variants. This is done by
unchecking the corresponding variants in the last column:

image::assembly-data-do-not-mount.png[alt="Exclude from assembly variants"]

So this component won't be contained in the BOM for _3V3_, but it will be
contained in the BOM for the other two assembly variants.

[NOTE]
====
If your project contains only one assembly variant, the last column won't
display its name. In that case there will be just a plain checkbox, but
this procedure works exactly the same way.
====

[#alternative-parts]
=== Example: Alternative Parts (2nd Source)

Another possible use-case is to specify alternative part numbers (or
attributes) for a component, to make the assembly house know which other
parts they can choose if the primary part is out of stock.

This is done by selecting the corresponding assembly option row and
clicking on the btn:[Add Part By MPN] button multiple times, once for
each alternative part. The first one is automatically considered as
the _primary_ part, while any further parts are _alternative_ parts.
The result should look like that:

image::assembly-data-alternative-mpns.png[alt="Specify alternative MPNs"]

This will cause the BOM to include three additional columns (those ending
with `+[#]+` where `+#+` is an incrementing number) for each alternative
part (common columns omitted and text abbreviated for readability):

[%header,format=csv]
|===
Value,MPN,Manufacturer,Value[2],MPN[2],Manufacturer[2],Value[3],MPN[3],Manufacturer[3]
,LMV321,ST,,MCP6001,Microchip,,OPA338,TI
|===

Instead of specifying alternative parts by MPN, you could also specify
alternative parts by attributes exactly the same way -- just specify
attributes instead of MPNs ðŸ˜‰

=== Example: Different Assembly Variants

Last but not least, it is also possible to include a component in
multiple assembly variants, but using different parts. This can be
done by adding multiple rows with the btn:[Add Device] button and
selecting the checkboxes accordingly.

For example to assemble the part _LMV321LILT_ in the _3V3_ assembly
variant, but _OPA338NA/250_ in the other two assembly variants, it
would look like that:

image::assembly-data-different-mpns.png[alt="Specify different MPNs"]

Once again, exactly the same procedure works for specifying different
attributes instead of MPNs:

image::assembly-data-different-attributes.png[alt="Specify different attributes"]

In this example, the BOM for the _3V3_ assembly variant specifies 100nF
for the capacitor, while the BOMs for the other variants specify 220nF.

== Usage Of Assembly Data

As explained earlier, the assembly data is mainly used for the BOM export.
However, there are also some other things depending on assembly data.

=== Schematics

In schematics, typically you see the attributes and/or MPNs next to each
component (usually in the `+{{VALUE}}+` label). But as you should now
understand, this data could depend on the assembly variant or there could
also be multiple MPNs added to a component. So the question arises, which
of them is displayed in schematics?

The rules for substituting the placeholder `+{{VALUE}}+` in schematics are
as follows:

1. If there exists at least one board, and the first board (which is
   considered as the _primary_ board) contains a device for the component
   in question, and there is at least one part assigned to that device,
   any attributes from that first part are displayed in schematics.
2. If there is no such board, device or part, but the component has
   at least one part assigned, any attributes from that first part are
   displayed instead.
3. If there is no part assigned to the component at all, only the direct
   component attributes are taken into account (which are not depending
   on the assembly variant, and usually don't contain an MPN). Note that
   component attributes are always taken into account anyway in case a
   part doesn't specify a particular attribute (fallback mechanism).

=== 3D Board Viewer

The 3D board viewer displays only devices which are contained in the first
defined assembly variant (i.e. the _default_ variant). So if a device is
excluded from that assembly variant, its 3D model won't show up in the
3D view.

=== BOM Output Job

The biggest effect of assembly data is for sure the BOM export. As
explained above, for each assembly variant a separate BOM file will
be created. Strictly speaking, this is not always true since it is
configurable -- but at least it's the default behavior.

Let's take a look at the options of the BOM output job:

image::bom-output-job.png[alt="BOM output job"]

1) Name::
  Name of the output job as shown in the list on the left (no impact on
  the exported files).

2) Output::
  File path of the BOM files to generate. Since multiple files might
  be generated, placeholders are required to avoid conflicting file paths.
  The most important placeholder here is `+{{VARIANT}}+` which will be
  substituted by the name of the assembly variant (e.g. _Std_).

3) Custom Attributes::
  Comma-separated list of additional columns to be included in the BOM CSV
  files. For example the value `SUPPLIER,DATASHEET` adds two more columns to
  the CSV with the component attributes `SUPPLIER` and `DATASHEET`.
  Usually this field can just be left empty.

4) Boards::
  Selection of boards to export BOMs for. If your project contains multiple
  boards and you want to get a BOM for each of them (since they usually
  differ!), you may choose _All_ or _Custom_ here. +
  *Attention*: If multiple boards are selected, you have to add the
  placeholder `+{{BOARD}}+` (or any other board-specific attribute) to
  the output file path to avoid generating conflicting files!

5) Assembly Variants::
  This option does exactly the same as the _Boards_ option, just for
  assembly variants. Here you'll see that _All_ is selected by default to
  get a separate BOM file for each assembly variant. And that's why the
  `+{{VARIANT}}+` placeholder is contained in the output file path by
  default.

For the latter two options, the value _Default_ just means that the _first_
object is used, i.e. the first board or the first assembly variant.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Note that *every generated BOM will contain only those components which
are contained in the corresponding assembly variant*. Components
excluded from a particular assembly variant won't appear in the BOM at
all (no "do-not-mount" mark or something like that).

Similarly, only components actually added to the selected board will be
contained in the BOM. Even if a component is contained in an assembly
variant, but not added to the board selected for the export, it won't be
contained in the BOM.

If a component specifies multiple parts (e.g. for second source reasons),
the BOM will contain additional columns to include all those parts. So
the number of columns depends on the maximum number of parts added to
components. Of course only those parts valid for the selected board will
be contained in the BOM.
====

=== Other Output Jobs

Although the BOM export is the primary use for assembly data, the same
concept also applies to these output jobs:

* Pick&Place CSV / Gerber X3
* Board STEP Model

== Software Architecture

For the nerds among us, this diagram about the underlying software
architecture might help to understand this feature:
