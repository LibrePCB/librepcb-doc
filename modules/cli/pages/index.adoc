= Command-Line Interface

LibrePCB also provides a command line interface (CLI). With that tool, you
can automate some tasks, for example on Continuous Integration (CI) systems.

====
Please note that (at this time) `librepcb-cli` requires a running X-server
even if it doesn't open any windows. If your system doesn't have an X-server
running, you can use link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xvfb[xvfb] instead:

[source,bash]
----
$ xvfb-run -a librepcb-cli [args]
----

If the `librepcb-cli` executable still doesn't work, you may need to install
some dependencies. On Debian/Ubuntu, following packages need to be installed:

[source,bash]
----
$ apt-get install libfontconfig1 libglib2.0-0 libglu1-mesa
