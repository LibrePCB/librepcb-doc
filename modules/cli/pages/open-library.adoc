LibrePCB Command Line Interface

Options:
  -h, --help     Print this message.
  -V, --version  Displays version information.
  -v, --verbose  Verbose output.
  --all          Perform the selected action(s) on all elements contained in
                 the opened library.
  --check        Run the library element check, print all non-approved messages
                 and report failure (exit code = 1) if there are non-approved
                 messages.
  --minify-step  Minify the STEP models of all packages. Only works in
                 conjunction with '--all'. Pass '--save' to write the minified
                 files to disk.
  --save         Save library (and contained elements if '--all' is given)
                 before closing them (useful to upgrade file format).
  --strict       Fail if the opened files are not strictly canonical, i.e.
                 there would be changes when saving the library elements.

Arguments:
  open-library   Open a library to execute library-related tasks.
  library        Path to library directory (*.lplib).

=== Check Library Elements and Upgrade File Format

This command is useful for Continuous Integration of LibrePCB libraries because
it reports failure if you check in libraries with invalid or non-canonical
S-Expression files or STEP models. In addition, the library check is run
(`--check`) and reports failure if there are any non-approved messages.
