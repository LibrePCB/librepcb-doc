Options:
  -h, --help                         Print this message.
  -v, --version                      Displays version information.
  --verbose                          Verbose output.
  --erc                              Run the electrical rule check, print all
                                     non-approved warnings/errors and report
                                     failure (exit code = 1) if there are
                                     non-approved messages.
  --export-schematics <file>         Export schematics to given file(s).
                                     Existing files will be overwritten.
                                     Supported file extensions: pdf, svg, png
  --export-bom <file>                Export generic BOM to given file(s).
                                     Existing files will be overwritten.

  --export-board-bom <file>          Export board-specific BOM to given
                                     file(s). Existing files will be
                                     overwritten. Supported file extensions: csv
  --bom-attributes <attributes>      Comma-separated list of additional
                                     attributes to be exported to the BOM.
                                     Example: "MANUFACTURER, MPN"
  --export-pcb-fabrication-data      Export PCB fabrication data
                                     (Gerber/Excellon) according the fabrication
                                     output settings of boards. Existing files
                                     will be overwritten.
  --pcb-fabrication-settings <file>  Override PCB fabrication output settings
                                     by providing a *.lp file containing custom
                                     settings. If not set, the settings from the
                                     boards will be used instead.
  --export-pnp-top <file>            Export pick&place file for automated
                                     assembly of the top board side. Existing
                                     files will be overwritten. Supported file
                                     extensions: csv, gbr
  --export-pnp-bottom <file>         Export pick&place file for automated
                                     assembly of the bottom board side. Existing
                                     files will be overwritten. Supported file
                                     extensions: csv, gbr
  --board <name>                     The name of the board(s) to export. Can be
                                     given multiple times. If not set, all
                                     boards are exported.
  --board-index <index>              Same as '--board', but allows to specify
                                     boards by index instead of by name.
  --remove-other-boards              Remove all boards not specified with
                                     '--board[-index]' from the project before
                                     executing all the other actions. If
                                     '--board[-index]' is not passed, all boards
                                     will be removed. Pass '--save' to save the
                                     modified project to disk.
  --save                             Save project before closing it (useful to
                                     upgrade file format).
  --strict                           Fail if the project files are not strictly
                                     canonical, i.e. there would be changes when
                                     saving the project. Note that this option
                                     is not available for *.lppz files.

Arguments:
  open-project                       Open a project to execute project-related
                                     tasks.
  project                            Path to project file (*.lpp[z]).

=== Check ERC Messages and Export Schematics & Boards

This command is useful for Continuous Integration of LibrePCB projects because
it reports failure if you check in projects with non-approved ERC messages. In
addition, it generates all production data so you don't have to do it manually.

In this example, the application reported errors and exited with code 1
because there are non-approved ERC messages.
