                                     set, the settings from the boards will be
                                     used instead.

                                     boards are exported.
  --board-index <index>              Same as '--board', but allows to specify
                                     boards by index instead of by name.
  --remove-other-boards              Remove all boards not specified with
                                     '--board[-index]' from the project before

                                     '--board[-index]' is not passed, all boards
                                     will be removed. Pass '--save' to save the
                                     modified project to disk.
  --variant <name>                   The name of the assembly variant(s) to

  --variant-index <index>            Same as '--variant', but allows to specify
                                     assembly variants by index instead of by
                                     name.
  --set-default-variant <name>       Move the specified assembly variant to the
                                     top before executing all the other actions.
                                     Pass '--save' to save the modified project
                                     to disk.
  --save                             Save project before closing it (useful to
                                     upgrade file format).
  --strict                           Fail if the project files are not strictly
                                     canonical, i.e. there would be changes when
                                     saving the project. Note that this option
                                     is not available for *.lppz files.

Arguments:
  open-project                       Open a project to execute project-related
                                     tasks.
  project                            Path to project file (*.lpp[z]).

=== Run ERC, DRC and Output Jobs

This command is useful for Continuous Integration of LibrePCB projects because
it reports failure if you check in projects with non-approved ERC or DRC
messages. In addition, it generates all production data files of the
configured output jobs so you don't have to do it manually.

Finished with errors!

In this example, the application reported errors and exited with code `1`
because there are non-approved ERC/DRC messages.
