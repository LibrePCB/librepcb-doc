= Device

The last library element you need to create is the device which combines
the component _Single OpAmp_ with the package _SOT23-5_. This is actually
the only library element which is specifically for {example-part-name} --
all previously created elements are generic and reusable for other OpAmps!

Again, open menu:New Library Element[Device] and specify the name and
category for the new device:

== Choose Component & Package

After clicking btn:[Next], you need to choose the component and package
we created for this device:

Then click on btn:[Finish].

== Connect Pads To Signals

Now you have to connect the package pads to component signals according
to the pinout in the datasheet of {example-part-name}:

Then *save the device* to finish it and quickly wait until the background
library scan completes before adding the new device to a project.

And that's it! The {example-part-name} is now ready to be added to
schematics and boards. And because the categories, symbol, component
and package are very generic, you created not only one single device,
but the basement for many more devices in the future! For any additional
single-channel OpAmp (with an already available package), you need to
create only a device which is now a matter of a minute.
