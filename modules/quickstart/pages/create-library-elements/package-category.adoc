= Package Category

Before creating a package for the {example-part-name}, you should
(optionally) create a category for it. This is done exactly the same
way as you already created the
xref:create-library-elements/component-category.adoc[component category].

Since we need to create a _SOT23-5_ package, let's choose the following
properties for its category:

* *Name*: _Small-Outline Transistor (SOT)_
* *Parent*: _Transistor_ (let's assume this category exists already)

With a click on btn:[Finish] the package category is complete and
after a moment the new category is ready to use.
