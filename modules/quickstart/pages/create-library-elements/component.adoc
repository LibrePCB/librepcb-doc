= Component

The next element you need to create is the component for a single OpAmp.
Because it is still very generic (beside the {example-part-name} there
are many other OpAmps with exactly the same functionality), you should
enter a generic name like _Single OpAmp_.

Open menu:New Library Element[Component], enter the name and assign the
component category we created previously:

== Set Properties

After clicking on btn:[Next] you're asked to specify some properties of
the component:

Schematic-Only::
  Check this if the component must not appear on a board, but only in
  the schematics. This is typically used for schematic frames.

Prefix::
  When adding the component to a schematic, its name (designator) is
  automatically set to this value, followed by an incrementing number. So
  if you choose the prefix _R_, components added to a schematic will have
  the names _R1_, _R2_, _R3_ and so on. The prefix should be very short
  and uppercase.

Default Value::
  In addition to the name, components also have a value assigned to it,
  which is typically also displayed in the schematic. For example a
  capacitor has its capacitance (e.g. _100nF_) set as its value. When
  adding a component to a schematic, its value is initially set to the
  value specified here. The value can also be a placeholder, for example
  `+{{PARTNUMBER}}+`, `+{{DEVICE}}+` or `+{{CAPACITANCE}}+`. If you are
  unsure, just leave it empty, the component editor will help you to
  assign a value later.

[#add-symbols]
== Add Symbols (aka _Gates_)

Now you need to choose the symbols which represent the component in
schematics (also called _gates_). Most components have only one symbol,
but you can also add more than one, for example an OpAmp could have
separate symbols for power and amplifier. In our case, select the
_Single OpAmp_ symbol we created previously:

Don't forget to click on the btn:[*+*] button after closing the symbol
chooser dialog. Then click on btn:[Next].

== Add Signals

The next step is to define all so-called signals of a component. Signals
represent the "electrical interface" of a component. For example a
transistor consists of the signals _Base_, _Collector_ and _Emitter_.
For a component it's irrelevant whether the "real" transistor has
multiple emitter pads, or an additional thermal pad and so on -- the
component only specifies the three electrical signals.

LibrePCB automatically extracts the signals from the pins of the specified
symbols, so often you don't have to do this by hand. But sometimes you still
should adjust the names or properties of these signals. For our OpAmp, we
check the _Required_ checkbox of all signals to ensure the ERC will raise
a warning if these signals are not connected to a net in the schematics:

== Connect Pins To Signals

These signals now need to be assigned to the corresponding symbol pins
to create the connections. But since they were automatically generated
from the pins, you can just click on
btn:[Automatically assign all signals by name]:

== Component Editor

After clicking on btn:[Finish], the component is complete:

[NOTE]
====
For our simple example this procedure might feel a bit complicated. This
is due to the broad flexibility of the LibrePCB library approach which
will safe time in the long term due to high reusability of library elements.

The component which we created uses only very basic library features, but
as soon as you understand the library concept in more detail, you will be
able to easily create much more complicated library elements. We're sure
you will learn to love the flexibility of the library concept step by step.

== Recommendations

====
Following are the most important rules to create reusable components:

* Create generic components whenever possible. Only create specific
  components for manufacturer-specific parts (like microcontrollers).
* Generally name signals according their electrical purpose
  (e.g. _Source_, _Drain_, _Gate_).
* Don't add multiple signals which are considered as connected. Even for a
  microcontroller which has multiple _GND_ pins, the component should
  have only one _GND_ signal. Keep in mind that a component represents
  the _electrical_ interface of a part, not the _mechanical_!
