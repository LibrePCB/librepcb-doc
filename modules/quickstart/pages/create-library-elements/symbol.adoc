= Symbol

Now we need to create a symbol for the OpAmp. Open
menu:New Library Element[Symbol], choose a name and the component
category we just created and click btn:[Finish]:

== Draw Polygons

Now let's draw the graphical objects of the symbol:

. Choose a tool. There are several similar tools available, but often you
  need only the btn:[Draw Rectangle] or the btn:[Draw Polygon] tool.
. Specify the polygon properties. *For the symbol's "body", choose the
  _Outlines_ layer.* When checking _Grab Area_, you'll be able to drag
  the symbol in the schematic editor by clicking on the polygon's area.
. Draw the polygon with the cursor.

== Add Texts

Then you should *add at least two text objects*:

* *Name*: Using the placeholder `+{{NAME}}+` which will be substituted by
  the component's designator (e.g. "R5") in the schematics.
* *Value*: Using the placeholder `+{{VALUE}}+` which will be substituted
  by the component's value (e.g. "100nF") in the schematics.

For convenience, there are dedicated tools for these two text objects.
Use them as follows:

. Start one of the text tools.
. If needed, adjust the text properties in the toolbar.
. Place the text object with a mouse click. Press kbd:[R] or
  kbd:[Right Click] to rotate or kbd:[M] to mirror the alignment while
  moving.

== Add Pins

Then, the most important thing is to add pins since these are required later
in the schematics to attach wires to the symbol.

. Start the btn:[Add Pin] tool.
. Choose a reasonable (unique!) pin name and length. Press kbd:[Tab] to
  move the focus into the name input field.
. Place the pin with a mouse click. Press kbd:[R] or
  kbd:[Right Click] to rotate while moving.

The overlapping pin texts look a bit ugly, but let's ignore that for
the moment.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It's not possible to add multiple pins with the same name. If your device
for example has multiple _GND_ pads which are all connected together (i.e.
you don't need to distinguish between them), add *only one* _GND_ pin to the
symbol. If you need to distinguish between the different pins, assign
unique names (e.g. _GND_1_, _GND_2_ etc.).
====

Now *save the symbol* to let the background scan picking up the new
symbol (this takes a moment) before you can use this symbol in a component.

== Recommendations

====
For details about how symbols should be designed, please take a look at our
xref:library-conventions:symbols.adoc[symbol conventions]. The most important
rules are:

- For generic components, create generic symbols (e.g. _Diode_ instead of
  _1N4007_).
- The origin (coordinate _0,0_) should be in (or close to) the center of the
  symbol.
- Pins must represent the _electrical_ interface of a part, not the
  _mechanical_. So don't add multiple pins with the same function (e.g. _GND_)
  and don't name pins according their location in the package. Name them
  according their electrical purpose (e.g. _IN+_, _IN-_, _OUT_) instead, or
  just use incrementing numbers (i.e. _1_, _2_, _3_, ...).
- Pins should be grouped by functionality and placed on the 2.54mm grid.
- There should be text elements for `+{{NAME}}+` and `+{{VALUE}}+`.
