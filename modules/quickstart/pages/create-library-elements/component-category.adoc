= Component Category

First you should create a component category for the {example-part-name}
(if it doesn't exist already). Open
menu:New Library Element[Component Category], choose a suitable (generic!)
name and select a parent category. *You may first need to create the
required parent categories.*

[NOTE]
====
Creating component categories is optional. Everything works even without
creating such categories so if you're in a hurry, just skip this step.
However, categories help to keep your libraries organized and to quickly
find components in the schematic editor.
====

In our example, we choose the following properties (any other metadata is
optional):

* *Name*: _Amplifiers_ (since the {example-part-name} is an amplifier)
* *Parent*: _Integrated Circuits â€º Linear_ (let's assume these categories
  exist already)

[TIP]
====
If you're unsure about the category name, take a look at the navigation
trees of https://digikey.com or https://mouser.com for inspiration. But
don't use a nesting level higher than 3 levels (usually 2 levels are
enough).

After clicking on btn:[Finish], your first component category is already
complete! It may just take a moment for the background library scan until
the new component category appears in the category trees.
