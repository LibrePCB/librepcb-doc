= Package

Then you need to create the package for the {example-part-name}, which is
called _SOT23-5_. As usual, open menu:New Library Element[Package] and
specify the name and category:

== Add Pads

Now you need to specify all pads of the package. The _SOT23-5_ has 5
pads named from _1_ to _5_, so you can just enter the term _1..5_ and
click on the btn:[+] button:

[NOTE]
====
When adding the pads, don't consider their electrical functions or
internal connections. For example if a transistor with three electrical
signals has three pads plus a thermal pad connected to one of the
other signals, the package has *four* pads in total. It's not relevant
whether some of them are connected to each other _within_ the package.

General rule of thumb: If in doubt, better specify too many pads than too
few ;-)
====

== Place Pads

After clicking on btn:[Finish], you can draw the footprint. It's recommended
to start with placing the pads:

. Set a reasonable grid interval with the btn:[Grid Properties] toolbutton.
. Start either the btn:[Add THT Pad] or btn:[Add SMT Pad] tool.
. Choose the package pad to place and specify its properties, most notably
  the shape and size.
. Place the pad with a click. Press kbd:[R] to rotate it while moving.

[NOTE]
====
The tool only allows to place pads on the grid. To specify exact
coordinates, just place the pads rougly and open btn:[Properties] from
the pad's context menu (right-click) afterwards to enter exact values.

== Draw Polygons

Then add graphical object just
xref:create-library-elements/symbol.adoc#draw-polygons[as done in the symbol editor]:

image::package-draw-polygon.png[alt="Draw polygon"]

[NOTE]
====
It's recommended to add at least two polygons:

* One *on the _Top Documentation_ layer* to represent the body outline of
  the package. This layer will appear on assembly drawings, but not on the
  PCB silkscreen.
* One *on the _Top Legend_ layer* to include a placement help which will
  be visible on the PCB silkscreen -- *most notably pad-1 markings*.

To create highly functional, beautiful looking footprints, check out
our xref:library-conventions:packages.adoc[package conventions].
====

== Add Texts

Just xref:create-library-elements/symbol.adoc#add-texts[like in the symbol],
you should add `+{{NAME}}+` and a `+{{VALUE}}+` text objects:

image::package-add-text.png[alt="Add text"]

== Add Non-Plated Holes

In case your package requires to drill non-plated holes into the PCB
(for example to insert a screw), use the btn:[Add Hole] tool and
specify its diameter. However, for our _SOT23-5_ package we don't need
a hole.

That's all you need for a simple package! Now *save the package* to ensure
the background library scan picks up the new package.

== Add 3D Model

If you have a STEP file of the package, you can add it as a 3D model to the
package. Switch to the 3D mode with menu:View[Toggle 2D/3D Mode] or by
pressing kbd:[Ctrl+3]. Then click on the btn:[+] button to import the
STEP file (this may take a while):

If required, the position and rotation can be adjusted in the footprint
variants table.

== Recommendations

====
For details about how packages should be designed, please take a look at our
xref:library-conventions:packages.adoc[package conventions]. The most important
rules are:

- Create generic packages, not specific ones. For example _DIP08_ is
  _DIP08_ -- no matter whether it's an OpAmp, an EEPROM or a microcontroller.
- The origin (coordinate _0,0_) should be in (or near to) the center of
  the package body.
- Footprints must always be drawn from the top-view. When a footprint needs
  to appear on the bottom of a board, this can be done in the board by
  flipping it.
- Add *all* pads of a package, not only the one you currently need. For
  example if the package has a thermal pad, you should add it, even if
  you currently don't need it.
- Name pads according IPC-7351 (if applicable; see
  xref:library-conventions:packages.adoc[package conventions] for more
  information), typically just _1_, _2_, _3_ etc. Only name pads according
  their electrical purpose (e.g. _Anode_) if the package is very specific
  for a particular purpose (like an LED).
- Pad 1 should always be at the top left.
- There should be text elements for `+{{NAME}}+` and `+{{VALUE}}+`.
