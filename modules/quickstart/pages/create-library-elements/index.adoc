= Create Library Elements

Sooner or later you'll need to create your own library elements in your
local library you have created xref:create-local-library.adoc[previously].
Open that library in the library manager:

The btn:[New Library Element] toolbutton (or kbd:[Ctrl+N]) in the
library editor is the entry point for every new library element. There
you can choose what kind of library element you want to create:

== Concept Overview

But first we need a crash course to understand the basics of LibrePCB's
library concept. A library consists of several different elements:

Component Category::
  These are basically "metadata-only" elements used to categorize the
  "real" library elements in a category tree. Every symbol, component
  and device can be assigned to one or more categories to make them
  browsable in the category tree you used in the schematic editor for
  xref:create-project/schematics.adoc#add-devices[adding components/devices].
  Examples: _Resistors_. _LEDs_, _Microcontrollers_

Symbol::
  A symbol is the graphical representation of a component (or parts of it)
  in a schematic. It consists of electrical pins and graphical objects
  like lines.
  Examples: _European Resistor_, _LED_, _1x10 Connector_

Component::
  A component basically represents a "generic" kind of electrical part.
  It's *not* a real part which you can buy, it's just theoretical. The
  component defines the electrical interface of a part and how it is
  represented in the schematic (by referencing one ore more symbols). But
  it does not define how the part looks physically on a board.
  Examples: _Resistor_, _Bipolar Capacitor_, _4-channel OpAmp_

Package Category::
  Exactly the same as the component category, but for packages instead of
  components. This allows to browse packages in a category tree.
  Examples: _Chip Resistors_, _Axial Capacitors_, _DIP_

Package::
  As the name suggests, packages represent the mechanical part of a
  "real" electronic part. It contains the footprint with their electrical
  pads and graphical objects which is then added to boards. Later a
  package may also contain a 3D model for the 3D board viewer.
  Examples: _TO220_, _DIP20_, _LQFP32_

Device::
  The device now represents a real electronic part which you can buy. It
  basically combines a component with a package and defines the pinout
  to connect component signals with package pads.
  Examples: _0805 Resistor_, _LM358D_, _STM32F103C_

[IMPORTANT]
====
The order of this list is also the order to follow when creating new
library elements. For example a device always needs to be created *after*
the corresponding component. The other direction is not possible because
of the dependencies.
====

No worries if this is a bit too much theory for now. The rest of the
tutorial is more practical, which will help you to understand the concept
step by step.

[#example]
== Our Example: {example-part-name}

Let's say you want to create the part *{example-part-name}* (OpAmp, see
link:{example-datasheet-url}[datasheet]) from A to Z. We will now create
all the necessary library elements for the {example-part-name}, though
in practice you only need to create the elements which do not exist
already. You can even use elements from other libraries, for example
the symbol from library _X_, the component from library _Y_ and the
package from library _Z_.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It's really important to understand how to re-use already existing
components and packages. In many cases, your desired component
(e.g. _Single OpAmp_) and package (e.g. _SOT23-5_) already exist in our
libraries. *Then the only element you have to create is the device,
which just takes a minute.*

If you want to learn the whole concept, follow the tutorial (recommended).
If you only want to create a device, skip the basics and go directly to
the xref:create-library-elements/device.adoc[device tutorial].

Here an overview which library elements we'll create for the
{example-part-name}:

  _Integrated Circuits › Linear › Amplifiers_
* xref:create-library-elements/symbol.adoc[*Symbol*]:
  _Single OpAmp_
* xref:create-library-elements/component.adoc[*Component*]:
  _Single OpAmp_
* xref:create-library-elements/package-category.adoc[*Package category*]:
  _SOT_
* xref:create-library-elements/package.adoc[*Package*]:
  _SOT23-5_
