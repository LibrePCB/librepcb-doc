= Order PCB

The easiest and fastest way to order the PCB is <<librepcb-fab>>. It
automatically exports and uploads all the necessary production data
files without annoying you with the whole traditional production data
workflow. See https://fab.librepcb.org/about for more information.

[TIP]
====
*You prefer to manually generate the production data files?* Or you want
to use a PCB manufacturer not available at <<librepcb-fab>>? No problem!
Just skip this section and go to <<generate-production-data>>.
====

== LibrePCB Fab

To start the order process, click the btn:[Order PCB] toolbutton in either
the schematic- or board editor:

With btn:[Upload Project], the project is uploaded to our order service
https://fab.librepcb.org. Then your web browser should open a website
where you can review and continue the order.

[TIP]
====
Alternatively you could also export your LibrePCB project as a `*.lppz`
archive (menu:File[Export > Export *.lppz Archive]) and then upload
this file with the web browser on https://fab.librepcb.org. This
procedure might be useful if for some reason the direct upload is not
desired or doesn't work (e.g. due to a corporate firewall).
====

== Generate Production Data

Instead of using <<librepcb-fab>>, of course you can also generate the
production data manually and forward these files to any PCB manufacturer
you like.

=== Gerber/Excellon

Open menu:File[Production Data > Generate Fabrication Data] or press
kbd:[F10]. Then choose the settings of the Gerber/Excellon export.
Generally you should determine what format your PCB manufacturer accepts.
Many manufacturers accept Protel-style settings, so if you're unsure,
click on btn:[Protel naming]:

Press btn:[Generate] and LibrePCB writes the files into the selected
directory within the project. These files can then be sent to your PCB
manufacturer for production.

[WARNING]
====
It's highly recommended to cross-check the generated files with third-party
tools like http://gerbv.geda-project.org[gerbv] or
https://gerber.ucamco.com/[the reference Gerber viewer]. LibrePCB
developers are not responsible for any implications caused by wrong
production data.
====

=== Pick&Place Data

If you also need pick&place files for automated assembly, open
menu:File[Production Data > Generate Pick&Place Files] or press kbd:[F11]:

== Export BOM

To get a list of all parts to purchase, export the bill of materials (BOM)
from either the schematic editor or board editor with
menu:File[Production Data > Generate Bill Of Materials] or with kbd:[F9]:

image::board-bom.png[alt="Generate BOM"]

[IMPORTANT]
====
The BOM depends on the board since the concrete devices are specified in
the board, not in schematics. Therefore, make sure the desired board is
selected in the dropdown. However, if you start the BOM export in the
board editor (instead of the schematic editor), the currently opened
board will be pre-selected automatically.
====

[NOTE]
====
LibrePCB does not yet provide a built-in mechanism to specify manufacturer
part numbers (MPN). This will be added in a future release. However, you
can already add arbitrary attributes to each component which can then be
included in the BOM. Just open btn:[Properties] from the context menu
of components (right-click) and add a string attribute named `MPN`.
