= Order PCB

The easiest and fastest way to order the PCB is <<librepcb-fab>>. It
automatically exports and uploads all the necessary production data
files without annoying you with the whole traditional production data
workflow. See https://fab.librepcb.org/about for more information.

[TIP]
====
*You prefer to manually generate the production data files?* Or you want
to use a PCB manufacturer not available at <<librepcb-fab>>? No problem!
Just skip this section and go to <<generate-production-data>>.
====

== LibrePCB Fab

To start the order process, click the btn:[Order PCB] toolbutton in either
the schematic- or board editor:

With btn:[Upload Project], the project is uploaded to our order service
https://fab.librepcb.org. Then your web browser should open a website
where you can review and continue the order.

[TIP]
====
Alternatively you could also export your LibrePCB project as a `*.lppz`
archive (menu:File[Export > Export *.lppz Archive]) and then upload
this file with the web browser on https://fab.librepcb.org. This
procedure might be useful if for some reason the direct upload is not
desired or doesn't work (e.g. due to a corporate firewall).
====

== Generate Production Data

Instead of using <<librepcb-fab>>, of course you can also generate the
production data manually and forward these files to any PCB manufacturer
you like.

Currently there exist multiple ways how to generate production data, but
it's recommended to use the *Output Jobs* feature for that. Click on
menu:File[Output Jobs] or press kbd:[F11] to open the corresponding window:

Then for any output you like to generate, click on the btn:[+] button at the
bottom left. See the following sections for details on the available jobs.

[NOTE]
====
Any files generated through output jobs will be written to the path
`./output/<VERSION>/` within the project directory, where `<VERSION>`
is the project's version number as defined in the *Project Setup* dialog.
So make sure the version number is set as desired to avoid overwriting
e.g. the output files of a previous PCB version.
====

Once you set up all output jobs, just click on the "Run all jobs" button
and all files will be written to the output directory. Then click on
btn:[OK] and save the project to store the output jobs configuration.

=== Gerber/Excellon

For the Gerber/Excellon production data you need to choose the settings of
the Gerber/Excellon export. There are two different presets built-in, a
default style and a Protel style. Generally you should determine what format
your PCB manufacturer accepts. Many manufacturers accept Protel-style
settings, so if you're unsure, choose *Gerber/Excellon (Protel Style)*.

If required, the settings can now be adjusted manually.

[WARNING]
====
It's highly recommended to cross-check the generated files with third-party
tools like http://gerbv.geda-project.org[gerbv] or
https://gerber.ucamco.com/[the reference Gerber viewer]. LibrePCB
developers are not responsible for any implications caused by wrong
production data.

=== Pick&Place Data

If you also need pick&place files for automated assembly, just choose
*Pick&Place (+*+.csv)* (or alternatively ther Gerber X3 variant):

=== Bill of Materials

To get a bill of materials (BOM), add the output job
*Bill Of Materials (+*+.csv)*:
