= Create Schematics

Before starting with the board layout, a schematic will be needed. So
let's see how to draw a schematic.

== Add Frame

First, you may want to add a frame to the schematic. Click on
btn:[Add Component] in the toolbar and select a schematic frame:

image::schematic-add-frame.png[alt="Add schematic frame"]

After clicking on btn:[OK], the selected component is attached to the
cursor. Click on the origin of your schematics to place the frame at
coordinate (0, 0).

Press kbd:[Esc] to finish the placement. The _Add Component_ dialog pops
up again to choose the next component. Press kbd:[Esc] again to leave the
tool.

== Add Components/Devices

Now add all the resistors, capacitors, ICs etc. the same way to your
schematic. However, for real parts (in contrast to the schematic frame)
the dialog lets you select a concrete device. Here an explanation about
the displayed information:

You can choose between adding a *component* or a *device*:

* *Component*: Defines the schematic symbol and netlist signals. It's all
  you need in a schematic, but it does not represent a concrete part and
  does not specify the package to be placed on the board.
* *Device*: Represents a real, orderable part (with
  MPNfootnote:[Manufacturer part number]). Basically it's the combination
  of a component and a package with a particular pinout.

To add a part to a board, you need to choose a *device*. However, it's
your choice whether to select it _now_ or _later_ when starting with the
board layout. This allows to draw the complete schematics even if various
packages and devices do not exist yet in your libraries.

[TIP]
====
While placing components, press kbd:[R] to rotate or kbd:[M] to mirror. With
kbd:[Tab] the focus is moved into the toolbar to allow specifying a value.
====

Supply symbols like VCC or GND are added exactly the same way since these
are ordinary library elements as well. However, they are also provided in
a dedicated toolbar for a quick access to the most commonly used elements.

[NOTE]
====
The _Add Component_ dialog lists all the components and devices available
in the libraries you have installed in your workspace. *If you are missing
something, you either need to
xref:install-remote-libraries.adoc[install more libraries] or
xref:create-library-elements/index.adoc[create your own library elements].*

To create your own library elements, follow the linked tutorial. You can
keep the project open while working in the library editor. Afterwards,
*wait for the background library scan to complete* (indicated as a progress
bar at the bottom right of the window). Then the new library elements
will appear in the _Add Component_ dialog and are ready to be used.
====

== Draw Wires

Once your schematic contains some components, the pins can be connected with
the btn:[Draw Wire] tool. Just click on a pin to start a new wire:

[IMPORTANT]
====
Pay attention to the circles around the pins. If a wire appears to be
starting at a pin, but the circle is visible, it is *not* connected.

The color of the pin circles even provide some more context:

* *Red*: Mandatory pin, i.e. needs to be connected to a wire (if not, an
  ERCfootnote:[Electrical rule check] warning is raised).
* *Green*: Optional pin, i.e. may or may not be connected, depending on
  the use-case. No ERC error will be raised if left unconnected.
====

== Add Net Labels

To keep schematics clean and readable, net labels may be added. They allow
to explicitly specify net names, and to create hidden connections between
wires of the same net name.

. Start the btn:[Add Net Label] tool.
. click on the wire where to attach the label.
. Click to specify the label position.

[TIP]
====
While placing labels, press kbd:[R] to rotate.

[NOTE]
====
All wires in the whole project which have the same name assigned will
automatically be connected, even accross schematic pages.
====

== Add More Sheets

For larger projects, you may want to split the schematics into multiple
sheets for better readability. Just add more sheets with
menu:Schematic[New Sheet], then add a frame and devices the same way.
Use supply symbols and net labels to connect nets across pages.

== Electrical Rule Check

At latest when you're finished with the schematics, you should check if
there are no critical ERC messages. The ERC does not need to be triggered
since it is automatically updated.

Open the ERC dock with menu:View[Go to Dock > Electrical Rule Check (ERC)]:

Note that the _Board Errors_ can be ignored for now since we didn't create
the board yet. Just fix the _Schematic Errors_, then _Schematic Warnings_.
Usually the _Circuit Errors_ and _Circuit Warnings_ will then disappear
automatically.
