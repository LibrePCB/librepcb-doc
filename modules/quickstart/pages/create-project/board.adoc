= Create Board

Once the schematic is (more or less) complete, you can start designing the
PCB in the board editor. If the board editor window is not opened already,
click on the btn:[Board Editor] toolbutton to open it.

== Set Grid Properties

All board editor tools (e.g. the _Draw Trace_ tool) work on a particular
grid interval, i.e. the cursor snaps on a multiple of that value. The
value might depend on the task you're working on so probably you'll need
to change it several times while working on the board.

You can change it at any time with the btn:[Grid Properties] toolbutton
(or with kbd:[F4]):

== Draw Outlines

The most important thing of the board is its outline. Generally there must be
**a single, closed polygon on the _Board Outlines_ layer**. It is recommended
to set its **line width to 0.0mm** since -- in contrast to many other polygons
-- this polygon does not represent any actual material but only the outer
dimension of the PCB.

If your PCB needs non-plated cut-outs (e.g. slots, windows, ...), draw
these polygons on the _Board Cutouts_ layer with a width of 0.0mm.

[IMPORTANT]
====
*A simple board outline polygon is automatically added by LibrePCB when
creating a new project or board!* So usually the only thing you need to do
is to *resize it to the desired size*. The instructions here are intended
only to explain more complicated scenarios and in case you want to re-draw
the outline from scratch.
====

[WARNING]
====
All polygons on the _Board Outlines_  and _Board Cutouts_ layers shall
represent the actual board outlines (i.e. the edges), **NOT** the paths
for the milling cutter! The PCB manufacturer will automatically offset
the outline polygons to calculate the actual paths for the cutter.
====

image::board-outlines.png[alt="Draw board outlines"]

[NOTE]
====
Keep in mind that inner edges can only be produced with a specific minimum
radius (corresponding to the milling cutter diameter of the PCB manufacturer).
Although PCB manufacturers may produce your PCB anyway even if it contains
inner edges with no or too small radius, it's highly recommended to draw
all inner edges with a proper radius. Often a radius of 1.2mm or more works
fine, while a smaller radius might lead to additional cost.

To draw polygons with arcs, open btn:[Properties] from the polygon's
context menu (right-click) and specify the vertex coordinates and angles
manually.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
*A correct board outline is really crucial to avoid problems during the
PCB manufacturing process!* Make sure to fulfil these rules:

* There's exactly one polygon on the _Board Outlines_ layer.
* Cut-out polygons (if there are any) are on the _Board Cutouts_ layer and
  located fully inside the outer board outline.
* There are no tangent or intersecting polygons on these two layers.
* The line width of those polygons is 0.0mm (optional, but recommended).
* Polygons are closed (start and end coordinates are exactly identical) and
  consisting of a single polygon object (**NOT** multiple joined lines!).
* There are no other objects on these two layers.
====

[TIP]
====
An easy way to check if the board outline is valid is to review the PCB in
the 3D viewer. For that, open menu:View[Toggle 2D/3D Mode] or press
kbd:[Ctrl+3].
====

== Place Devices

For every component in the schematic, you need to place a device
in the board (except schematic-only components, like the schematic frame).

. Open the _Place Devices_ dock (menu:View[Go to Dock > Place Devices]).
. Select a component to place.
. Select the desired device for that component (not needed if the device
  is already specified in the schematics).
. Choose the exact footprint to place, if there are multiple. Most packages
  have only one footprint -- if not, the default footprint is pre-selected.
. Click btn:[Add] and place the device with the cursor on the board. Press
  kbd:[R] to rotate or kbd:[F] to flip to the other board side while moving.

image::board-add-device.png[alt="Add device to board"]

Repeat these steps until there are no more unplaced components.

[TIP]
====
If you want to use the same device and footprint for all instances of
a particular component, use the btn:[Add Similar] button to add all
at once.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
*If you can't find the desired device for a component (or the device
dropdown is completely empty), you need to add the device to your
local library first.* Continue with the
xref:create-library-elements/index.adoc[library element creation tutorial]
and come back to the board editor once the device is created.
====

By the way, it's even possible to replace devices after adding them to
the board. For example you can replace a 0603 resistor by a 0805 resistor
using the btn:[Change Device] context menu item (right-click):

image::board-change-device.png[alt="Change device"]

Exactly the same way you can switch to a different footprint, just use
the btn:[Change Footprint] context menu item instead.

== Draw Traces

As soon as you add devices to the board, airwires will appear to show
the missing traces. Start the btn:[Draw Trace] tool and specify the
trace settings in the toolbar. Then click on a pad to start a new trace:

image::board-draw-trace.png[alt="Draw trace"]

[NOTE]
====
The cursor automatically snaps on objects of the same net. If this is not
desired, hold kbd:[Shift] while drawing.
====

[TIP]
====
With the right mouse button you can cycle through the different routing modes.

To switch to a different copper layer while drawing a trace, press
kbd:[Page Down] (next lower layer) or kbd:[Page Up] (next higher layer).
This will automatically insert a via if needed.

There are also shortcuts to change trace & via properties, see
menu:Help[Keyboard Shortcuts Reference] for details.
====

[#add-planes]
== Add Planes (Copper Pours)

If you need planes (also known as _copper pours_, i.e. filled copper areas
to create electrical connections), proceed as follows:

. Start the btn:[Draw Plane] tool.
. Specify the electrical net and copper layer in the toolbar.
. Add vertices with mouse clicks. To fill the whole board, an approximate
  outline is good enough since it will be clipped automatically.

image::board-draw-plane.png[alt="Draw plane"]

One the plane area is calculated, it appears with a filled area. As you can see,
the area is automatically clipped to the board outline:

image::board-plane.png[alt="Filled plane"]

[IMPORTANT]
====
*In case your plane does not get filled*, make sure:

* The board outline polygon exists and fulfils all the
  <<draw-outlines,rules listed above>>.
* The plane is located _within_ the board outlines.
* There is at least one copper element of the same net located within the
  plane area -- e.g. a via, pad or trace. *Plane areas which are not
  connected to any copper element are automatically discarded* to avoid
  electrically "floating" copper areas on the board. If you prefer to
  add these copper areas anyway, open btn:[Properties] from the plane
  context menu (right-click) and check the _Keep Islands_ option.
====

[TIP]
====
To avoid plane areas cluttering up the view too much, they can be hidden
with menu:View[Hide All Planes]. They will still be there, they are just
hidden on the screen.
====

To interconnect planes on different copper layers, just place vias with
the btn:[Add Via] tool within the plane areas. Make sure the vias have
the same net as the plane. Vias will also prevent plane fragments from
disappearing if there's no other copper element within the plane and the
_Keep Islands_ option is disabled.

[#add-holes]
== Add Non-Plated Holes

Non-plated holes can be added to the board with the btn:[Add Hole] tool.
Just specify the diameter and click on the desired position. Afterwards,
use the btn:[Properties] context menu item to specify the exact position
if needed (e.g. if not located on the grid interval).

== Design Rule Check

Once your design is complete, you should run the design rule check (DRC)
to ensure there are no critical mistakes.

But first you should check or adjust the design rules which are
used to calculate via/pad restrings and cream/stop mask clearances.
For that, open menu:Board[Board Setup] or press kbd:[F7] and navigate
to the *Design Rules* tab:

image::board-design-rules.png[alt="Design rules"]

[NOTE]
====
Actually it's better to set the design rules _before_ drawing traces and
adding planes since they affect the clearances. It is only moved to the
end of the boards tutorial to keep the focus on the design workflow.

Fortunately, usually the default values are fine. So if you're unsure
about these values, just keep the defaults.
====

Afterwards, navigate to the next tab called *DRC Settings* and configure
the settings according the capabilities of your desired PCB manufacturer:

image::board-drc-settings.png[alt="DRC settings"]

If you're unsure, just skip this for now (the default values are usually fine).

Once all settings are configured, open menu:Board[Design Rule Check] or
press kbd:[F8] to run the DRC. This can take some time. The DRC dock widget
should automatically appear to display the result:

image::board-drc-dock.png[alt="DRC dock"]

Then just click on a message to highlight the issue in the board editor.
Or click on btn:[?] to get some more information about a message. If you're
sure a message is not relevant, you could approve it with btn:[âœ”] but
usually warnings/errors should be fixed instead of approved.

[TIP]
====
There's also a tool named *Quick Check* which runs only the most important
checks of the DRC. It is intended to be run regularly while working on the
layout and can be triggered with kbd:[Shift + F8].
====

== 3D Preview

Once you fixed all ERC issues, it's highly recommended to review the
PCB in the 3D viewer. If anything with the board outline, the device
placement or something like that is not correct, chances are high you
will notice that in the 3D view. Click on menu:View[Toggle 2D/3D Mode] or
press kbd:[Ctrl+3] to open it (press it two times for fullscreen):

image::board-3d.png[alt="3D viewer"]

Note that not all packages have a 3D model assigned, like the OpAmp in
our example. But no worries, this does not cause any issues.

If everything looks as expected, you're ready to order the PCB!
