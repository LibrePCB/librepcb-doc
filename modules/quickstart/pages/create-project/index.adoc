= Create a PCB Project

In LibrePCB, schematics and boards are always part of a project, so before
creating schematics and boards you first need to create a project for every
PCB. Click on btn:[New Project] in the control panel:

Then specify some project metadata:

[TIP]
====
It's recommended to store projects within the workspace subdirectory
named `projects` (the default location suggested by the wizard) because
these projects are then shown in the control panel file explorer, making
them easy to locate and use. But of course projects can be created at
any other location as well.

[NOTE]
====
A LibrePCB project consists of a whole directory on the file system. While
it is possible to manually add/modify files in that directory, generally
you should avoid adding large files (e.g. datasheets) since this _could_
slow down some operations. It's better to store unrelated files outside of
the project directory.
====

Now you can choose whether the project should be initialized with a first
schematic page and board, and how they are named. If you are unsure, just
accept the default values:

After clicking on btn:[Finish], the schematic- and board editors show up:
