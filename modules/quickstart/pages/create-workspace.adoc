= Create a Workspace

When starting LibrePCB the first time, a wizard asks you to open or create a
workspace. The workspace is just a directory where settings, libraries and
(optionally) projects will be stored. Once created, it can be used from all
supported operating systems (i.e. it is platform independent) and from any
LibrePCB version.

You can just accept the default workspace location (you could still move it
to another location afterwards, if desired):

If the selected path does not contain a workspace yet, clicking on btn:[Next]
will show a page to choose the most important settings:

It is recommended to select at least your *preferred norm* and *length unit*
since these usually depend on where you're living.

[NOTE]
====
You can change these settings at any time later in the control panel under
menu:Extras[Workspace Settings].

After clicking btn:[Finish], the control panel shows up and you're ready to
start using LibrePCB!
