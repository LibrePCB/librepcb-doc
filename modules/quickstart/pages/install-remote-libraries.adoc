= Install Remote Libraries

Before you can start creating new projects, you need to add some libraries
to your workspace. Libraries contain various kinds of elements which can be
added to schematics and boards (e.g. symbols, footprints and devices).

Click on btn:[Library Manager] in the control panel:

The library manager immediately fetches the list of available libraries from
the Internet. Most of these libraries are hosted at
https://github.com/LibrePCB-Libraries.

The most important library is _LibrePCB Base_ because it contains commonly
used library elements like resistors or diodes. It is highly recommended to
install at least this library. However, you can even simply install all the
available libraries at once:

Later you can keep the installed libraries up to date exactly the same way.
Just open the library manager from time to time to see which libraries can
be updated to a new version.

[NOTE]
====
Dependencies between different libraries are automatically taken into account
when changing the selection. So for example if you select _LibrePCB Connectors_,
the _LibrePCB Base Library_ will automatically be selected too because the
connectors library depends on it.
====

[WARNING]
====
Downloaded (so-called _remote_-) libraries are always read-only because
otherwise local modifications could cause conflicts when updating the library
the next time. But this is no problem, just follow this tutorial to create your
own local library later. In a local library you can use or even override
library elements from remote libraries by specifying a higher version number.
====

[TIP]
====
If you are familiar with version control systems (e.g. _Git_) and want to use
them to manage your libraries (instead of the library manager), just clone the
libraries into the subdirectory `v0.1/libraries/local/` in your workspace.
====

After the selected libraries have been downloaded, they will appear in the
list of installed libraries on the left side of the library manager:

Note that after the libraries were installed, it takes a moment to create an
index of all the contained elements. This process automatically runs in
background and is indicated with a progress bar at the bottom right of all
main windows. The installed libraries are ready to use once the progress bar
disappears.
