= Create a Local Library

In addition to the (read-only) remote libraries, you should create a personal,
so-called _local_ library. This is the place where you'll add your own symbols,
footprints etc. later.

To do so, go to the _Create local library_ tab, optionally enter some
metadata (default values are good enough) and click on btn:[Create Library]:

If you're curious how the library looks like, select your library on the left
and then click on btn:[Open Library Editor] (or just double-click on your
library):

You'll see an empty library editor since the library doesn't contain any
elements yet.

*Your workspace setup is now complete and ready to start creating your
first PCB project!* You can close both the library editor and the library
manager for now. We'll come back to the library editor later when we need to
xref:create-library-elements/index.adoc[create our own library elements].
