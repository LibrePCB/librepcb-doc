= Package

Then you need to create the Package for the {example-part-name}, which is called
_SOT23-5_. After specifying some metadata (like you already did for other
library elements), you are asked to specify all pads of the Package. The
_SOT23-5_ has 5 pads which we just name from _1_ to _5_:

After that, you can start drawing the footprint of the Package. It's recommended
to start with the pads:

And then add other graphical items like the outline, name and value:

That is already enough for a simple footprint.

.Package Conventions
[NOTE]
====
For details about how Packages should be designed, please take a look at our
xref:library-conventions:packages.adoc[package conventions]. The most important
rules are:

- Create generic packages, not specific ones. For example _DIP08_ is _DIP08_ --
  no matter whether it's an OpAmp, an EEPROM or a microcontroller.
- The origin (coordinate _0,0_) should be in the center of the Package body.
- Footprints must be drawn from the top-view. When a footprint needs to appear
  on the bottom of a board, this can be done in the board by mirroring it.
- Add *all* pads of a package, not only the one you currently need. For example
  if the package has a thermal pad, you should add it, even if you currently
  don't need it.
- Name pads according IPC-7351 (if applicable; see section Library
  Conventions for more information), typically just _1_, _2_, _3_ etc. Only
  name pads according their electrical purpose (e.g. _Gate_) if the Package is
  very specific for a particular purpose.
- Pin 1 should always be at the top left.
- There should be text elements for `+{{NAME}}+` and `+{{VALUE}}+`.
