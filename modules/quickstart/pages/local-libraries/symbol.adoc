= Symbol

Now we need to create a Symbol for the OpAmp. Click on the
_Symbol_ button in the _New Library Element_ wizard, fill in some metadata
and click on _Finish_. Now you can place the required pins (choose reasonable
and unique names!), add the `+{{NAME}}+` and `+{{VALUE}}+` text elements and
draw the outline. The result should look like this:

_Yes, the overlapping pin texts look ugly, but let's ignore that for the
moment ;)_

.Symbol Conventions
[NOTE]
====
For details about how symbols should be designed, please take a look at our
xref:library-conventions:symbols.adoc[symbol conventions]. The most important
rules are:

- For generic components, create generic symbols (e.g. _Diode_ instead of
  _1N4007_).
- The origin (coordinate _0,0_) should be in (or close to) the center of the
  symbol.
- Pins must represent the _electrical_ interface of a part, not the
  _mechanical_. So don't add multiple pins with the same function (e.g. _GND_)
  and don't name pins according their location in the package. Name them
  according their electrical purpose (e.g. _IN+_, _IN-_, _OUT_) instead, or
  just use incrementing numbers (i.e. _1_, _2_, _3_, ...).
- Pins should be grouped by functionality and must be placed on the 2.54mm
  grid.
- There should be text elements for `+{{NAME}}+` and `+{{VALUE}}+`.
