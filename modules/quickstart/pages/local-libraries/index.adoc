= Create Local Libraries

Of course you can also create your own libraries. To do so, enter some metadata
in the tab _Create local library_ and click on _Create Library_:

Now you can open the library editor to create some symbols and footprints in
your new library. Select your library on the left and then click on the
_Open Library Editor_ button:

Now we need a crash course to understand the basics of LibrePCB's library
concept ;) A library consists of several different elements:

* *Component Category*:
  These are basically "metadata-only" elements used to categorize the "real"
  library elements in a category tree. Every Symbol, Component and Device can be
  assigned to one or more categories so they will appear in the category tree.
  Examples: _Resistors_. _LEDs_, _Microcontrollers_
* *Symbol*:
  A symbol is the graphical representation of a Component (or parts of it) in a
  schematic. It consists of electrical pins and graphical objects like lines.
  Examples: _European Resistor_, _LED_, _1x10 Connector_
* *Component*:
  A Component basically represents a "generic" kind of electrical part. It's
  *not* a real part which you can buy, it's just theoretical. The Component
  defines the electrical interface of a part and how it is represented in the
  schematic (by referencing one ore more Symbols). But it does not define how
  the part looks like in a board.
  Examples: _Resistor_, _Bipolar Capacitor_, _4-channel OpAmp_
* *Package Category*:
  Exactly the same as Component Categories, but for Packages instead of
  Components.
  Examples: _Chip Resistors_, _Axial Capacitors_, _DIP_
* *Package*:
  As the name suggests, packages represent the mechanical part of a "real"
  electronic part. It contains the footprint with their electrical pads and
  graphical objects which is then added to boards. Later a package may also
  contain a 3D model for the 3D board viewer.
  Examples: _TO220_, _DIP20_, _LQFP32_
* *Device*:
  The Device now represents a real electronic part which you can buy. It
  basically combines a Component with a Package to specify how a Component
  looks like on the board.
  Examples: _0805 Resistor_, _LM358D_, _STM32F103C_

[NOTE]
====
The order of this list is actually also the order to follow when creating new
library elements. For example a Device always needs to be created *after* the
corresponding Component. The other direction is not possible because of the
dependencies.

Ready to create your first library elements? At the top left of the library
editor there is the entry point for every new library element. There you can
choose which of the six library element type you want to create:

*Example: {example-part-name}*

Let's say you want to create the part {example-part-name} from A to Z. We will
create now all the necessary library elements for the {example-part-name},
though in practice you only need to create the elements which do not already
exist. You can even use elements from other libraries, for example the Symbol
from library _A_, the Component from library _B_ and the Package from library
_C_.
