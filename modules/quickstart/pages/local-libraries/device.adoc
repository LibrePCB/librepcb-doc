= Device

The last library element you need to create is the Device which combines the
Component _Single OpAmp_ with the Package _SOT23-5_. This is actually the only
library element which is specifically for {example-part-name} -- all previously
created elements are generic!

Again, specify some metadata about the Device first. Then you need to choose
the Component and Package you want to assign:

Then you have to assign the Package pads to Component signals according to
the datasheet of the {example-part-name}:

And that's it! In the library overview (the first tab in the Library Editor)
you can see all the elements you have created:

The {example-part-name} is now ready to be added to schematics and boards.
And because the Categories, Symbol, Component and Package are quite generic,
they can also be used for many other library elements :)
