= Component

The next element you need to create is the Component for a single OpAmp. Because
it is still very generic (beside the {example-part-name} there are many other
OpAmps with exactly the same functionality), so you should enter a generic name
like _Single OpAmp_. In addition, it's really important to choose a Category for
the new Component, otherwise it's hard to find it in the library when you want
to add it to a schematic.

Then you're asked to specify some properties of the Component:

* *Schematic-Only*: This should be checked if the Component must not appear on
  a board, but only in the schematics. This is typically used for schematic
  frames (yes, they are also Components).
* *Prefix*: When adding the Component to a schematic, its name (designator) is
  automatically set to this value, followed by an incrementing number. So if
  you choose the prefix _R_, components added to a schematic will have the names
  _R1_, _R2_, _R3_ and so on. The prefix should be very short and uppercase.
* *Default Value*: In addition to the name, Components also have a value
  assigned to it, which is typically also displayed in the schematic. For
  example a capacitor has its capacitance (e.g. _100nF_) set in its value.
  When adding a Component to a schematic, its value is initially set to the
  value specified here. The value can also be a placeholder, for example
  `+{{PARTNUMBER}}+`, `+{{RESISTANCE}}+` or `+{{CAPACITANCE}}+`. If you are
  unsure, just leave it empty, you can still change it later.

Now you need to choose the Symbols which represent the Component in schematics.
Most Components have only one Symbol, but you can also add more than one, for
example an OpAmp can have separate Symbols for power and amplifier.

After adding the OpAmp Symbol, it should look like this:

The next step is to define all so-called Signals of a Component. Signals
represent the "electrical interface" of a Component. For example a transistor
consists of the Signals _base_, _collector_ and _emitter_. For a Component
it's irrelevant whether the "real" transistor has multiple emitter pads, or
an additional thermal pad and so on, the Component only specifies the three
Signals.

LibrePCB automatically extracts the Signals from the Pins of the specified
Symbols, so often we don't have to do this by hand. But sometimes you still
should adjust the names or properties of these Signals. For the OpAmp, we
check _Required_ for all Signals, so the ERC will show a warning if these
Signals are not connected to a net when the Component was added to a schematic:

These Signals now need to be assigned to the corresponding Symbol Pins, but as
they were automatically generated from the Pins, you can just click on the
button below to automatically assign all Pins to their Signals:

That's it, the Component is now ready to be used:

[NOTE]
====
For this simple example, this procedure may feel complicated. This
is due to the broad flexibility of the librepcb library approach. The Component
which we created actually only uses basic library features, but
as soon as you understand the our library concepts, you will be able to easily
create much more powerful library elements. We're sure you will love the
flexibility of the library concept ;)

.Following are the most important rules to create reusable Components:
[TIP]
====
- Create generic components whenever possible. Only create specific components
  for manufacturer-specific parts (like microcontrollers).
- Name signals according their electrical purpose (e.g. _Source_, _Drain_,
  _Gate_).
- Don't add multiple signals with the same name. Even for a microcontroller
  which has multiple GND pins, the component should have only one GND signal.
  A component represents the _electrical_ interface of a part, not the
  _mechanical_!
