= Logging Output

For various kinds of problems, it helps to see what LibrePCB internally does
and what low-level errors occurred but aren't displayed (in every detail)
in the graphical user interface.

Those messages are always written to `stderr` -- To see them, just run LibrePCB
from a terminal. Note that on Windows you have to redirect `stderr` to a file
and open the file in Notepad afterwards.

.Windows cmd.exe (PowerShell doesn't work!)

[source,bash]
----
"C:\Program Files\LibrePCB\bin\librepcb.exe" > log.txt 2>&1
----

After closing LibrePCB, open `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\log.txt` in Notepad.

.MacOS Terminal

[source,bash]
----
/Applications/LibrePCB.app/Contents/MacOS/librepcb
----

.Linux/UNIX Shell

[source,bash]
----
/path/to/librepcb
----

Currently this is the only way to get logging messages. Logging to a file
is not implemented yet, and the verbosity cannot be configured.

.Example Output
