[NOTE]

These guidelines are not yet complete. Help us create sensible conventions

====

== Scope

The most important thing to consider when creating a package is the scope
of it. Since LibrePCB handles footprints differently than other EDA tools,
special attention is required here.

Think about the appearance of the part (the mechanical shape, dimension and
color). If two parts look exactly (or _almost_) equal, they can use the same
package. If they look different, two separate packages must be created.

[TIP]
====
*Don't think about the land pattern (i.e. footprint) of the part* -- it's not
relevant for this decision. Even if a package can be mounted differently on
a PCB (e.g. a THT resistor can be mount horizontally or vertically) and thus
require different footprints, only one package is needed. Similarly, two
different-looking parts that have the same land pattern (e.g. a SMD resistor
and a SMD LED) should still be two separate packages.
====

.Color (e.g. 0805 LED)
====
Even if a 0805 LED with a transparent lens has exactly the same footprint as a
0805 LED with a red lens, they should have *separate packages because of the
different color*. This way a device can link to the package with the proper
color, and thus it will appear with the proper color in the 3D PCB preview
(once LibrePCB supports 3D models).
====

.Height (e.g. SO-8)
====
Some packages are available in different heights. For instance, SO-8 is
available with heights of 1.2mm and 1.4mm. *As the 3D models would be different,
separate packages are needed*.

_Note: To avoid creating too many packages, a small tolerance is allowed. So for
a device with a height of 1.3mm you might want to use the package with a height
of 1.4mm._
====

.Mounting variants (e.g. TO220)
====
Many packages can be mounted either vertically or horizontally, for example the
TO220. If mounted horizontally, there might be a hole in the PCB to screw the
metal tab down to the PCB, or you may want to solder the tab to the PCB without
a hole in it. For all these cases *only one package is needed* -- the different
mounting variants should be handled by different footprint variants inside the
package.
====

== Naming

The following conventions apply to package names:

* We generally *follow IPC-7351 when naming packages*
  (e.g. "SOT23-5P95_280X145L60" instead of "SOT23-5"). Alternative names (like
  "SOT23-5") should be added to the comma-separated keywords list and maybe to
  the description.
* For packages not covered by IPC-7351, use following
  naming conventions:
** *Language must be American English* (en_US), if applicable (many packages
   have language-neutral names anyway).
** *Size information must use metric units*, not imperial units.
** For packages which are available with different pin counts, *append the pin
   count with a hyphen as separator and omit leading zeros* (e.g. "DIP-8"
   instead of "DIP08").
* For packages which are well known by their size in imperial units (e.g. "0805"
  which is "2012" in metric), it's recommended to write the well known name in
  parentheses. For example, a chip resistor could be named "RESC2012X70 (0805)".
* The name of manufacturer-specific packages should start with the manufacturers
  name (e.g. "Molex 53261-06"). _Note: Libraries do not act as namespaces for
  package names, so you should start the package name with the manufacturers
  name even if the package is located in a manufacturer-specific library._

== Pads

* *Always add all pads of packages*, even those which are not always connected.
  For example, the package "TO220" has a metal tab, so you should define it as
  a pad, no matter if it's often not connected (and even not connectable when
  mounted vertically).
* *Use pad names according {ipc7351-pdf}[IPC-7351]* (if applicable). For
  packages which are not covered by IPC-7351:
** If the function of a pad is absolutely clear, choose its abbreviated
   functionality as name (e.g. "A" for anode and "C" for cathode).
** Otherwise just use numbers starting with "1" at top left and increment
   them counterclockwise.

== Footprints

Within a package there can be multiple footprint variants. They are intended
to support the following use-cases:

* *Mounting variants*: For example, a THT resistor can be mounted either
  vertically or horizontally with various pad distances. Every common mounting
  variant should be available as footprint variants.
* *Soldering techniques*: Many packages can be soldered either by reflow-,
  wave- or hand-soldering, which usually require different land patterns. For
  every suitable soldering technique there could be a corresponding footprint
  variant.
* *Density levels*: {ipc7351-pdf}[IPC-7351] specifies three different density
  levels for footprints:
+
--
* Density Level A: Maximum (Most) Land Protrusion
* Density Level B: Median (Nominal) Land Protrusion
* Density Level C: Minimum (Least) Land Protrusion
--
If applicable, these three density levels should also be added as footprint
variants.

.Combinations
[NOTE]
====
As a given package might support multiple of the use-cases above, all suitable
combinations of them should be added. For example a package which should have
all three density levels as defined in IPC-7351 and can be mounted either
vertically or horizontally would need six footprint variants to support all
possible use-cases.
====

.Set default footprint
[IMPORTANT]
====
*The first footprint is always the default footprint*, so you should move
the most reasonable footprint to the top of the footprint list! The default
footprint should fulfill these rules:

* Generic packages: Designed according to IPC density level B (if applicable)
* Manufacturer-specific packages: Designed according to datasheet
* Suitable for reflow soldering (if applicable)
* Most natural mounting variant (e.g. horizontal for THT resistors, or
  vertical for Transistor Outline packages)

====

== Origin

*The origin _(0, 0)_ should be exactly at the center of the package body*. It
is used by pick and place machines.

Some packages (especially those with non-symmetrical body) have the origin
explicitly specified in the datasheet. In that case, use the origin from
the datasheet.

== Orientation

*Footprints must be drawn from the top-view*. When a footprint needs to appear
on the bottom of a board, this can be done in the board editor by mirroring it.

*Pin 1 should always be at the top left*, as defined in
{ipc7351c-slides-pdf}[IPC-7351C "Level A", slide 22].

== Legend Layer

[NOTE]
====
In LibrePCB 0.1.x, these layers were called _Top/Bottom Placement_.
Starting with LibrePCB 1.0, they are now called _Top/Bottom Legend_.
====

The _Top Legend_ layer is intended to be printed on silkscreen and thus
should contain information required for assembling the PCB. But don't put too
many things on that layer as it would waste space on the PCB!

Typically this layer should only contain some lines and dots to indicate where
and in which orientation the device gets assembled, for example an outline and
a dot next to pin 1.

*The legend should be drawn according to {ipc7351c-slides-pdf}[IPC-7351C]*.
The most important rules are the following:

* *It should stay visible after assembling the package* to allow reviewing
  positioning and orientation of assembled devices. In other words, the
  legend layer should primarily contain drawings _around_ the package's
  body, but not _under_ it.
* *Line width:* 0.2mm typical, 0.1mm minimum
* *Clearance to copper layers:* Equal or greater than the line width, but at
  least 0.15mm

====

== Documentation Layer

The layer _Top Documentation_ should be used to draw the most important
details of the package's appearance. It could be considered as an alternative
to the 3D model of a package. But in contrast to the 3D model, the
documentation layer is visible in the board editor while layouting the PCB.

Following things should be placed on the documentation layer:

* *The package's exact outline.* _Attention: The *outer* edges of the lines
  should correspond to the package's edges, *not* the middle of the lines!
  So, for example if the body is 5x5mm and the line width 0.2mm, you have to
  draw a 4.8x4.8mm rectangle._
* *The top view of the leads/legs:* The leads or legs of both THT and SMT
  pads should be drawn from the top view, i.e. the vertical projection of
  them. This is needed to make packages look realistic on the documentation
  layer, as leads and legs are an important part of the appearance of
  packages.
* *The contact area of SMT leads:* The area where SMT leads touch the copper
  land pattern should be drawn as *filled polygons with a line width of 0mm*.
  This helps the PCB designer to see the expansion of the land pattern, i.e.
  how much copper is around the actual lead.

====

== Package Outlines Layer

Every typical footprint should contain a single polygon on the
_Top Package Outlines_ layer to specify the outer dimension of the package.
It is used by the DRC to check the clearance between devices.

General rules:

* *Any leads shall be included*, but pads not.
* *Line width:* 0.0mm

====

====

== Courtyard Layer

Every typical footprint should contain a single polygon on the
_Top Courtyard_ layer to specify the area where no other device shall be
placed. It is used by the DRC to check this requirement. Usually this is
equal to the <<Package Outlines Layer>>, just with an offset of several 0.1mm.

General rules:

* *Line width:* 0.0mm
* *Offset to outlines:* According to IPC 7351 if applicable. A typical value
  for SMT devices is 0.2mm. For THT devices, a larger value (e.g. 0.4mm) is
  recommended.

====
image:footprint-courtyard-idc.png[]
====

== Text Elements

Typical footprints should have exactly two text elements: `+{{NAME}}+` and
`+{{VALUE}}+`.

The name should normally be placed at top of the package body, slightly above
the outline and aligned at bottom center. The value should be placed at the
bottom center, slightly below the package body and aligned at the top center.

*Always make sure that the text elements do not overlap with pads or with the
placement layer*. Otherwise the text might be unreadable on silkscreen. In
addition, text elements should usually be placed outside the package body to
still see them on silkscreen of an assembled PCB.

Keep in mind that the bottom-aligned anchor is placed on the text baseline.
This means that some letters like "g" or "y" might extend slightly below the
anchor.

.Special cases
[NOTE]
====
These rules should be fine for many packages, but probably not for all of
them. For special cases it's allowed to have slightly different properties
if they are more suitable.

== 3D Models

Packages might be populated with 3D models from STEP files. However, there
are several things to consider carefully.

Some general notes:

* *File size:* Try to keep STEP models as small as possible to avoid
  unnecessary long download- and loading times. Usually it is fine to
  keep STEP models rather simple (i.e. not adding too much details).
* *License:* Keep in mind that all libraries provided by LibrePCB are released
  under the
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license[CC0 Public Domain]
  license. This also applies to STEP models.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Almost every STEP model available in the Internet (whether from a manufacturer
or some other website) are not published under the CC0 license and sometimes
are also very bloated (way too detailed). Such models must not be contributed
to our official libraries (we won't accept them). We may change this
requirement some day, but at the moment this needs to be respected.

In addition, we prefer STEP models to be generated with
https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/[CadQuery] to allow making modifications
in future. Contributions of STEP models created in any other way may not
be accepted.
