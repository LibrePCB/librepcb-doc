= Download Remote Libraries

Before you can start with creating new projects, you need to add some libraries
to your Workspace. Libraries contain various kinds of elements which can be
added to schematics and boards (e.g. symbols and footprints).

To open the Library Manager, click on the corresponding button in the Control
Panel (or on the link in the shown warning, but the warning will disappear after
you add a library):

The Library Manager directly fetches the list of available libraries from the
Internet. Most of these libraries are hosted at
https://github.com/LibrePCB-Libraries.

[NOTE]
====
The provided libraries currently contain only a few elements. You are welcome to
contribute more elements by opening pull requests at
https://github.com/LibrePCB-Libraries[https://github.com/LibrePCB-Libraries]!
====

The most important library is the _LibrePCB Base_ library because it contains
the most commonly used library elements (like resistors or diodes). It is highly
recommended to install this library. To do so, just select the checkboxes at the
right and click on the _Download and install/update all selected libraries_
button:

By the way, the same way you can also update already installed libraries to the
latest version. You should regularly update all libraries to get more elements
and bugfixes/improvements of existing elements.

[NOTE]
====
Dependencies between different libraries are automatically taken into account
when changing the selection. So for example if you select _LibrePCB Connectors_,
the _LibrePCB Base Library_ will automatically be selected too because the
Connectors library depends on it.
====

[WARNING]
====
Downloaded (so-called _remote_-) libraries are always read-only because
otherwise local modifications could cause conflicts when updating the library
the next time. But this should not be an issue, just follow the guide below to
create your own local library. In a local library you can extend, or even
overwrite existing library elements (by using a higher version number to
enforce higher priority).
====

[TIP]
====
If you are familiar with Version Control Systems (e.g. _Git_) and want to use
them to manage your libraries (instead of the Library Manager), just clone the
libraries into the subdirectory `v0.1/libraries/local/` in your Workspace.
