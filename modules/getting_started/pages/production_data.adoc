= Generate Production Data

Once the board is finished, you can generate the production data for the PCB
manufacturer:

Here you can adjust some settings of the Gerber export. Generally you should
determine what format your PCB manufacturer accepts. Many manufacturers accept
Protel-style Gerber files, so if you're unsure, click on the _Protel naming_
button:

Then just click on the _Generate Gerber & Excellon Files_ button and LibrePCB
places the generated files in your project's _output_ subdirectory. These
files are then sent your PCB manufacturer for production.

[WARNING]
====
It's highly recommended to cross-check the generated files with 3rd-party tools
like http://gerbv.geda-project.org[gerbv] or
https://gerber.ucamco.com/[the reference gerber viewer]. LibrePCB is not
responsible for any implications caused by wrong production data.
