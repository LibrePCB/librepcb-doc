=== Create Boards

Once the schematic is (more or less) complete, you can start adding Devices
to the board. For every Component in the schematic, you need to place a Device
in the board (except schematic-only Components, like the schematic frame). In
the _Place Devices_ dock on the right side of the board editor you can see all
unplaced Components. For every Component you can choose its corresponding Device
now and add them to the board:

By the way, it's even possible to replace the Devices after adding them to
the board. So for example you can replace a _C-1210_ capacitor by a _C-0805_
capacitor just in the context menu of the Device:

Then you can start adding vias and traces to connect the pads together.
