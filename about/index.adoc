=== Project Status

LibrePCB is still under development and many features are not
implemented yet. So here's an overview about the project status:

[discrete]
==== What's working

* Downloading, creating and modifying libraries
* Drawing simple schematics with multiple sheets (incl. print or PDF export)
* Creating simple multilayer PCBs (incl. Gerber/Excellon export)

[discrete]
==== What's missing

* **No bill of materials (BOM) export**
  https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/wiki/Wishlist#project[[wishlist\]]
* **No design rule check**
* No hierarchical schematics
  https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/wiki/Wishlist#schematic-editor[[wishlist\]]
* No buses in schematics
  https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/wiki/Wishlist#schematic-editor[[wishlist\]]
* No 3D board viewer
  https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/wiki/Wishlist#board-editor[[wishlist\]]
* No clipboard functionality (cut/copy/paste)
  https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/issues/13[[#13\]]

Of course all these features will be implemented in future. Please consider to
