== Features

* Cross-platform (Unix/Linux, Mac OS X, Windows)
* All-In-One: project management + library/schematic/board editors
* Intuitive, modern and easy-to-use graphical user interface
* Very powerful library design with some innovative concepts
* Human-readable file formats for both libraries and projects
* Multi-PCB feature (different PCB variants of the same schematic)
* Automatic netlist synchronisation between schematic and board

== Project Status

LibrePCB is still under development and many things are not yet
working as expected. So here's an overview about the project status:

=== What's working (more or less)

* Downloading, creating and modifying libraries
* Drawing simple schematics with multiple sheets
* Creating simple PCBs (incl. Gerber export)

=== What's not working (or even missing)

* All editors:
** No clipboard functionality (cut/copy/paste)
   https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/issues/13[[#13\]]
* Schematic editor:
** No hierarchical sheets
   https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/wiki/Wishlist#schematic-editor[[wishlist\]]
** No buses
   https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/wiki/Wishlist#schematic-editor[[wishlist\]]
** No BOM export
   https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/wiki/Wishlist#project[[wishlist\]]
* Board editor:
** No DRC (design rule check)
** No 3D board viewer
   https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/wiki/Wishlist#board-editor[[wishlist\]]
** *Generally limited functionality and many bugs because it's still work in
   progress!*

Please don't open issues for these limitations - we know them and
are on the way to fix them ;) Especially the board editor has
currently high priority because this is critical for bringing out
a first official release of LibrePCB.
